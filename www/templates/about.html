      <div class="margin-border" align="justify">
        WiTTS, the Wireless Temperature Tracking System is an open source project
        created by Jason Choi in fulfillment of a Masters degree
        in Software Engineering at the University of California State Fullerton.
        It is a mobile application dedicated to medical professionals that aims
        to facilitate the day-to-day task of measuring and tracking patient temperature.
        WiTTS utilizes an NFC-enabled, battery-less temperature sensor to automate a
        large part of the procedure, saving time and reducing human error. </br></br></br>
