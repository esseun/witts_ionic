# WiTTS: Wireless Temperature Tracking System

WiTTS, the Wireless Temperature Tracking System is an open source project
(with restrictions) created by Jason Choi in fulfillment of a Masters degree
in Software Engineering at the University of California State Fullerton.
It is a mobile application dedicated to medical professionals that aims
to facilitate the day-to-day task of measuring and tracking patient temperature.
WiTTS utilizes an NFC-enabled, battery-less temperature sensor to automate a
large part of the procedure, saving time and reducing human error.
